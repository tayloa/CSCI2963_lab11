## Part 1
#### Part 2 and Part 3
I ended up up using Kiwi. I joined the channel, but I saw no activity. Observing the Slack channel, a majority of the chat was notifications of upcoming Hackathons, events in the CS department, or project schedules.

## Part 2
#### Part 2
I observed the TitanPad chat and found it very interesting. The users I observed didn't take the chat very seriously and seemed fun.
#### Part 4
##### Describe the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication.
  - They are both types of serial data calls with one main difference. Synchronous communication involves waiting for a response after making a call. You will not be able to execute your code until a respose is recieved. In asynchronous communication, you can send a message, continue your function, and have a callback function that responds when a response is recieved.
##### Compare the HCI issues in individual interaction with group interaction.
  - When making HCI work for an individual, you must take into account their abilities. User may have differnt levels of intellegence and may not pick up an interface if it is not as simple as possible. You must carefully choose tools that react according to each individual user’s needs and circumstances. On a group level you must do the same, but you must design an interface such that responses between users are universally understood.
##### Discuss several issues of social concern raised by collaborative software.
  - Issues with collaborative software include non-verbal communication, access, and productivity. The lack of non-verbal communication in groupware can lead to more misunderstangs. This can be quickly solved with video communication technology. As the scale of a collaborative process increases, the risk of data getting in the wrong hands increases. To avoid this problem a formal agreement can be made between the parties involved. An increase in scale can also hinder progress. Some tasks are better done outside of groupware than in groupware. Not everyone will have the same schedule.
##### Discuss the HCI issues in software that embodies human intention.  
  - In new instances of HCI, there has been a need for cognitive science. This is because users can have differnt goals and plans when using software. This can be seen with the addition of vocal recognition software. Users can now command computers through audio cues, but this leads to the necessity of analyting the user's tone and phrasing. Developers would have to find a way to translate human diction to code in order to make the computer return the users desired request.
