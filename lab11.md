-Describe the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication.
  - They are both types of serial data calls with one main difference. Synchronous communication involves waiting for a response after making a call. You will not be able to execute your code until a respose is recieved. In asynchronous communication, you can send a message, continue your function, and have a callback function that responds when a response is recieved.
-Compare the HCI issues in individual interaction with group interaction.
  - When making HCI work for an individual, you must take into account their abilities. User may have differnt levels of intellegence and may not pick up an interface if it is not as simple as possible. You must carefully choose tools that react according to each individual userâ€™s needs and circumstances. On a group level you must do the same, but you must design an interface such that responses between users are universally understood.
